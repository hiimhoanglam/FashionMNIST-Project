# Project Description
Using FashionMNIST datasets, we implement 2 dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA and t-SNE. We compare their ability to visualize data </br>
We also implement 2 classifier: Softmax Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks. We compare their ability to classify based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall metrics.
